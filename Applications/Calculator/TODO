TODO 
==========

(Optional) Change project structure to maven.
 - gradle can then build different packages to inject and show different errors.

Write Monkeyrunner script

Write UIAutomator tests

Write Junit tests

Fix ALL Android lint errors (for clarity)


Updates
=========

There where a few problems that were fixed in the new version:
- the gradle version **must** be 1.10 to build using Android tools (use ./gradlew when building)
- jpf did not detect the Eval.jar in the libs folder so it needed to be added to the classpath in *.jpf properties
- we need a better way of outputting results (especially if there where no errors)

- Added project directory config option in .jpf files. The problem was that we could not determine this directory
 reliable from the classpath and the source path might not be specified. We could do this automatically and make
 the project directory optional but for now it is not optional.
