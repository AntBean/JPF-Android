Updates
=========

There where a few problems that were fixed in the new version:
- the gradle version **must** be 1.10 to build using Android tools (use ./gradlew when building)
- jpf did not detect the Eval.jar in the libs folder so it needed to be added to the classpath in *.jpf properties
- we need a better way of outputting results (especially if there where no errors)
-  or run:

    `android update project -p .` in the main directory of the project.
